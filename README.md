# Portfolio Optimization | Optimization Methods in Finance (Course Project)

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing investment portfolios using linear and quadratic programming techniques applied to Nifty datasets. The key optimization models employed include the **Markowitz Model** and **Sharpe Ratio Model**. Additionally, portfolio rebalancing was performed using **integer and stochastic programming**, and **Monte Carlo simulations** were used to estimate **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**.

## Project Details
- **Course**: Optimization Methods in Finance
- **Institution**: IIT Kharagpur
- **Duration**: August 2023 - November 2023

## Key Features
- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Used **Markowitz Model** for mean-variance optimization.
  - Applied **Sharpe Ratio** for risk-adjusted return analysis.
  - Implemented **linear and quadratic programming** for efficient portfolio construction.

- **Portfolio Rebalancing**:
  - Applied **integer programming** to optimize discrete asset allocations.
  - Employed **stochastic programming** to account for uncertainties in market returns.

- **Risk Estimation**:
  - Utilized **Monte Carlo methods** to simulate asset returns and estimate risk metrics.
  - Calculated **VaR** and **CVaR** for risk management.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, PyPortfolioOpt, cvxpy, Matplotlib
- **Optimization**: Linear Programming, Quadratic Programming, Integer Programming
- **Risk Analysis**: Monte Carlo Simulation, VaR, CVaR

## Results
- Constructed efficient portfolios with optimal risk-return trade-offs.
- Rebalanced portfolios dynamically to maintain optimal allocation.
- Estimated risk metrics for various portfolios and demonstrated risk management techniques.
