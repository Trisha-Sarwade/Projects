## Portfolio Optimization | Optimization Methods in Finance (Course Project)

### Overview
This project focuses on optimizing investment portfolios using linear and quadratic programming techniques applied to Nifty datasets. The key optimization models employed include the **Markowitz Model** and **Sharpe Ratio Model**. Additionally, portfolio rebalancing was performed using **integer and stochastic programming**, and **Monte Carlo simulations** were used to estimate **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**.

## Federated Learning for Late Payment Risk Prediction | M-Tech Term Project

### Overview
This project aims to predict late payment risks in supply chain financing using **federated learning** techniques. The model leverages features such as **Late Delivery Risk**, **Payment Amount**, and others to improve risk assessment. The federated learning approach enables distributed model training across multiple clients without sharing sensitive data, addressing privacy concerns in supply chain operations.
